# auto-commit-action

âœ… Automatically Git commit via GitHub GraphQL API

This action will automatically commit (based on `path` input) to the repository with the message provided in
the `message` input.
The commit will be made by the user who owns the `GITHUB_TOKEN` provided.

> [!TIP]
> The commit will be signed commit and owned by github-actions[bot] if the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided by GitHub Actions.

  Can be achieved by using [`actions/checkout@v4`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout).

- The `contents: write` permission for the workflow job.
